The purpose of these notes is to develop an understanding of the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, a book that was recommended to me online

- I want to be a better programmer, and these notes are dedicated towards that
- I want to write better code than artificial intelligence
- I want to learn to understand programs and gain a better thinking on how to write them
